VMware NSX-T Data Center provides a high scale, policy-based overlay network reproducing the complete set of Layer 2
through Layer 7 networking services (for example, switching, routing, access control, fire-walling, QoS) in software for
the {product-title}â€™s native networking capabilities.

NSX-T components are xref:../../install_config/configuring_nsxtsdn.adoc#install-config-configuring-nsxt-sdn[installed and configured] as part of the Ansible installation procedure which integrates an {product-title} SDN
into a datacenter wide NSX-T virtualised network connecting bare metal, virtual machines and {product-title} pods.

For an {product-title} environment NSX-T Data Center is typically already configured for the entire datacenter with {product-title} integrating into this
existing environment using the *NSX-T Container Plug-In* (NCP).
